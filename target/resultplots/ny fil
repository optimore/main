A3 = [101,102], F25, 257it, OK
Changed to shorter forced V2 -> V2 and more and longer task actions for V2.
A3 = [101,102], F25, 182it, OK x 2
Longer V2 change criteria nrTask/2
A3 = [101,102], F35, 162it, OK x 3
Longer V2 change criteria ,  = nrTasks

A3 for F25 is ok, F30 and F35 is not solvable...
